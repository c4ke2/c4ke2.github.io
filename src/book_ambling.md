*Everan had finally caught his break. A poster from an up-and-coming mercenary band had reached the remote village of Shade's Edge.
Eager to pursue this new life he headed for Suncrest, only to find that the group was disbanded, their leader slaughtered by a monster hunter with flesh more stone than skin.
The path he's stumbled on drives close to the deepest corners of his past, the most vivid mysteries of the Ambling Expanse, and the dark presence wedged next to his mind.
But dangerous figures lurk along this path, emboldened by visions of a world beyond the Expanse, starving for progress by any means necessary.*

Across the Ambling Expanse is a character-focused fantasy story that is available on Amazon in both Ebook and paperback format!
